# Maramalade

Our team has had lots of experience recruiting for various organizations, and realized that the interview process consistently lacked coherence, consistency, and organization. While there have been some softwares for receiving applications or for managing hired employees, we were never able to find an application specifically for the interview process. Rather than using several non-specialized apps like Excel, Word, Sheets, Docs, Notion, Calendar, and more, Marmalade offers interviewers and companies an all-in-one solution for recruitment management. Marmalade's multitude of features allows recruitment teams to manage several applicants for multiple positions at a time, without having to navigate several platforms and pages. Marmalade is built with sorting functions for interview times to help interviewers easily find upcoming interviews, along with the ability to take notes and assign scores to each applicant. Once the team has completed interviews, Marmalade neatly displays the candidates by score and allows interviewers to mark their choices directly in the app. Marmalade was created with Firebase's Authentication and Realtime Database services, React JS, HTML/CSS/JS, and was designed with Figma and Adobe Illustrator.
